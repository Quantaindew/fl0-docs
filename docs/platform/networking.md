# Networking

## Outgoing IP Addresses
If you need FL0 to connect to external services, you might need to know the IP addresses that FL0 uses so you can whitelist them in your firewall settings.
Common examples of this include:

1. Connecting to a database hosted outside of FL0
2. Connecting to an SFTP
3. Connecting to a third party REST API

FL0's outgoing IP addresses are:
```
3.105.50.240
52.62.78.249
52.65.239.223
```

Please add these IPs to your firewall whitelist.

# How to Troubleshoot Github Connections

If you have problems connecting your Github organization to FL0, follow these troubleshooting steps:

1. Check if your Github organization is already connected to another FL0 workspace. Workspaces can be connected to multiple Github orgs, but a Github org can only be connected to a single Workspace
2. Uninstall the Github connector from your Github organization by navigating to [Github Application Settings](https://github.com/settings/installations)
3. Remove the Github connection in FL0 by navigating to **FL0 > Workspace > Workspace Settings > Git Connections** and clicking **Remove git connection**
4. Reinstall the Github connector by attempting to deploy your application again in FL0

If the steps above fail, please contact FL0 support.
